## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ARuizChang/EComerceStore.git
   cd EComerceStore
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```env
   PORT=what_port_you_want_to_use_for_the_backend
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   NODE_ENV=production_or_development
   ```

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start both the backend and frontend servers. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`, and the backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
